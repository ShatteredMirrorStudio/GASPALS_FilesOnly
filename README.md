# UE5 | GASPALS Project - Modified Files Only
## What is this project?
Yet another GASP extension project in a myriad of others. This one is focused primarily on first-person use with GASP and implementing old Advanced Locomotion System (ALS) overlay in a new and innovative way into the animation sample project. This repo contains only modified files, that you can simply copy into a fresh GASP project

## Features
- First-Person GASP template with several camera and movement options. From creating static camera FPS character with GASP body, to fully dynamic and immersive parkour character.
- Improved overlay system with separate Pose and Overlay layers. Easily combine base character pose and full body overlay.
- Seamlessly blends motion-matching movement with custom poses and overlays with only layering and animcurves.
- ALS and City Sample poses and animations. Combine not only old ALS animations, but also newer CitySample poses and accessories.
- Switching between FP and TP camera view.
- Obligatory climb-anywhere traversal system. 
- Custom widget to easily switch poses and overlays at runtime.
- Small fixes and improvements, like a check to stop character running into a wall (it was driving me crazy) or automatic view lock during FPS traversal.

## Notes
- If you want full version of this project, you can find it [Here](https://github.com/ShatteredMirrorStudio/GASPALS)
- Many of the blueprints and changes are commented, but lot of it is still a mess. Sorry.
- Traversal component is based on https://github.com/PolygonHive/GASP-ALS
